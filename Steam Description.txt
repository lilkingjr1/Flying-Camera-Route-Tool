[quote][b]Remember RCT3's Flying Camera Route Editor? This is basically the same thing, but for NL2! ðŸ˜ƒ[/b][/quote]
[i]Like what you see? Appreciate the months of hard work that went into making it?

[h1]Description:[/h1]
This tool is for setting up multiple waypoints to easily record advanced flying camera routes. The idea is that this tool should allow you to get sweeping/panning beauty shots of your coasters for any promotional videos without needing to know any scripting or having to set anything up. Yes, you can still use an invisible coaster with the scripted external camera, but this solution is designed to be more easier and faster to set up.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Set an [i]unlimited[/i] number of camera waypoints to fly to during the route.
    [*]Default waypoints bring the camera to a smoothed stop to focus on a point of interest. Can also be set to not stop and continue through the waypoint (smoothing between no-stop waypoints unfortunately not implimented yet -- NURBS math hard yo).
    [*]Rotate angle of camera at waypoints for stylistic shots.
    [*]Easily manage waypoints by cycling their preview cameras, and delete them too if desired.
    [*]Change fly time between cameras.
    [*]Average all fly times so fly times between waypoints are weighted based on their distance traveled (instead of a static time).
    [*]Have the camera route start based on a track trigger to get the perfectly timed shot!
